# 🚀 Quick GitHub Deployment Commands

These are the commands to deploy your satellite data analysis platform to GitHub Pages:

## 1️⃣ First, update your Vite configuration

Edit `vite.config.ts` and replace the commented line with your actual repository name:

```typescript
// Change this line:
// base: '/your-repo-name/',

// To this (replace 'satellite-data-analysis' with your chosen repo name):
base: '/satellite-data-analysis/',
```

## 2️⃣ Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory (if not already there)
cd /Users/originally/Desktop/space_Logistics3/rasterisation

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Satellite Data Analysis Educational Platform"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (REPLACE with your actual GitHub URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push to main branch
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# Build and deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

## 3️⃣ Configure GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.com
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll to "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Select "gh-pages" branch and "/ (root)" folder
6. Click "Save"

## 4️⃣ Your site will be live at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME/
```

## 🔄 To update your site later:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update: describe your changes"
git push origin main
npm run deploy
```
